                <p>
                    During a recent holiday with my friends, I noticed something different. We were spending significantly less time together than last holiday because many of them were constantly on apps like TikTok, doom-scrolling through content.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These holidays won't last forever, and I want to make the most of our time together. Unfortunately, apps designed to capture our attention have taken away precious moments of real connection and shared experiences.
                </p>
                <p class="highlight">
                    So please, reflect on your screen time. Reclaim your time and your life.
