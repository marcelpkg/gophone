        <h2>Why I Created This Website</h2>
        <p>
          During a recent holiday with my friends, I noticed something
          different. We were spending significantly less time together than last
          holiday because many of them were constantly on apps like TikTok,
          doom-scrolling through content.
        </p>
        <p>
          These holidays won't last forever, and I want to make the most of our
          time together. Unfortunately, apps designed to capture our attention
          have taken away precious moments of real connection and shared
          experiences.
        </p>
        <p class="highlight">
          So please, reflect on your screen time. Reclaim your time and your
          life.
