# scrolling.me
a simple website which shows you how much scrolling really affects your life.

## why?
today is my last day on holiday, and while reflecting on what a fun time it was, i realised that i spent so much less time with them, becuase instead of talking/spending time together, they were doom-scrolling on tiktok.

*so how does this help?*

hopefully, some people use this and realise how much time they are wasting. you only have one shot at life, so my point of view was always to make the most of it. most people can't remember what the last 3 videos they watched on tiktok were, just highlighting how much of a waste of time it is.
